We create a binary classification Deep Neural Network to determine whether a given individual has diabetes or not, given some health data (e.g. glucose levels, BMI). This is implemented from scratch using only numpy and no ML specific libraries. The project is divided into sections:

- [0: Data preparation]
- [1: Initialisation of hyperparameters]
- [2: Forward propagation]
- [3: Back propagation]
- [4: Updating parameters]
- [5: Testing and evaluation]

We will use a Neural Network with two hidden layers, each consisting of five nodes. The activation functions are fixed to be LINEAR -> RELU -> RELU -> Sigmoid.
