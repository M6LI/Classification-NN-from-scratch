We create a binary classification Deep Neural Network to determine whether objects passing nearby to Earth are hazardous. This is implemented from scratch using only numpy and no ML specific libraries. The training is done using a Kaggle dataset. The project will be divided into sections:

- [0: Data preparation]
- [1: Initialisation of hyperparameters]
- [2: Forward propagation]
- [3: Back propagation]
- [4: Updating parameters]
- [5: Testing and evaluation]

We will use a Neural Network with two hidden layers, each consisting of five nodes. The activation functions are fixed to be LINEAR -> RELU -> RELU -> Sigmoid.
